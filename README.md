# Inbox Eagle

An app that queries your emails and ranks them in importance based on which ones need a reply from you.

Configurable to use either a local LLM or an OpenAI API model.

## Getting started

1. `cp .env.example .env`
2. `cp prompt-config.example.json prompt-config-setup.json`
3. Set up GMail API credentials, and place the credentials JSON in this directory named `credentials-gmail.json`.
4. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. `cd client && npm ci`

## Running the script

Start by running the command line script to authorize Gmail and test the evaluation process:

```
$ python run_script.py
```

This'll save your credentials to a token.pickle file locally.

Next run the server and the front-end:

```sh
$ python start.py
```

Front-end client:

```sh
$ cd client
$ npm start
```

Here's some output from running `run_script.py` via the command line:
